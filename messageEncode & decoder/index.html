            <p>Cryptography is the use of codes and ciphers to protect secrets, Cryptography began thousands of years ago and until recent decades, it has been the story of what might be called classic cryptography — that is, methods of encryption that use pen and paper, or perhaps simple mechanical aids.
            Claude E. Shannon is considered by many to be the father of mathematical cryptography. Shannon worked for several years at Bell Labs, and during his time there, he produced an article entitled "A mathematical theory of cryptography". This article was written in 1945 and eventually was published in the Bell System Technical Journal in 1949. It is commonly accepted that this paper was the starting point for development of modern cryptography.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The development of cryptography has been paralleled by the development of cryptanalysis — the "breaking" of codes and ciphers. The discovery and application, early on, of frequency analysis to the reading of encrypted communications has, on occasion, altered the course of history. Thus the Zimmermann Telegram triggered the United States' entry into World War I; and Allies reading of Nazi Germany's ciphers shortened World War II, in some evaluations by as much as two years.</p><br>
            <p>Encryption in modern times is achieved by using algorithms that have a key to encrypt and decrypt information. These keys convert the messages and data into "digital gibberish" through encryption and then return them to the original form through decryption.</p>

              <h3 style="text-align: center;">HOW TO USE</h3>
              To use our site, you can either recieve an encrypted message with a key within one to 10 from a friend and then decrypt it to original message using our decryption page, or you can use our encryption page to convert your own original message to encrypted message, a key will be given to you which you can send with the encrypted message to a friend for decryption. <br>
              NOTE: <em>The method we use here is called "The Caesar's Rules" or Symetric key algorithms.</em>
